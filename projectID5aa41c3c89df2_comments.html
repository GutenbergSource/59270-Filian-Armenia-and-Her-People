<HTML><BODY>A description of Armenia, by an Armenian priest who was banished from his country. This book is from 1896, before the worst attrocities had taken place, and is a description of the country as it used to be.

<p>No particular difficulties in the text, so proofreading should be straightforward. The page of Armenian text will be included as an illustration, so no need to transcribe it.
